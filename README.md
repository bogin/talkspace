# Install

npm i sequelize 
npm i express
npm i  body-parser
npm i @types/express
npm i @types/body-parser

This app is not running. 
I took the chatGPT code and break it.
There is still a long way to go, creating types, env file, configs.
The code contant will not work and will require a lot of additions and mock data
to be tested. 

I have to say that that was one of the best home assigment I received.
